Hi! :wave:

**redux-eight-thousanders** is a very simple app I built as an exercise while learning Redux. It uses the @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux packages to manage React state.

I deployed it to Github pages, in case you want to check it out: https://jor-alv.github.io/redux-eight-thousanders/ :basecampy:

Here is a screenshot:
